# Responsive Accordion
This jQuery plugin provides responsive accordion functionality. 

I have created this jQuery accordion and want to make it responsive on smaller screens. I know there is a way to make this responsive using CSS media query but I am wondering if there is a better way of making it responsive using JS.
